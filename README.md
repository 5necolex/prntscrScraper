Edit:
I coded this 4 years ago, although I uploaded it a few years later. I was still learning the basics of programming; for that reason, my code may not be the prettiest. I stopped updating this repository because I wasn't seeing a lot of activity and I wasn't using it. Lately, it has been different and I have seen the interest for this script, so I will be updating this repository more often.
